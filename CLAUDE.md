# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A native macOS (SwiftUI, macOS 14+) **menu bar academic literature assistant**.
Migrated and refactored from the original Python `PaperBot`. It fetches papers
(OpenAlex), scores/recommends them, translates abstracts (DeepSeek), resolves
open-access PDFs, and manages reading status + notes.

All Swift source lives under [app/Sources/VellumX/](app/Sources/VellumX/).

## Build & run

The Swift package lives under `app/`. The app is wrapped into a code-signed
`.app` bundle (needed for the menu bar UI + entitlements).

```bash
# From the repo root — auto-detects the current branch as the variant:
scripts/build.sh            # release (default)
scripts/build.sh debug      # debug build

# Rebuild and relaunch in one step (preferred during development):
# Runs swift test first — restart aborts if any test fails.
scripts/restart.sh          # debug build, test→build→open
scripts/restart.sh release

# Run the unit test suite directly (forwards extra args to swift test):
scripts/test.sh
scripts/test.sh --filter VenueScorerTests

# Stream OS logs from all running VellumX instances:
scripts/log.sh

# Package into a distributable .dmg:
cd app && ./make-dmg.sh
```

See [scripts/](scripts/) for all helper scripts.

### Variant builds (multi-worktree)

`build-app.sh` (and its `scripts/build.sh` wrapper) auto-detect the current
git branch and derive a **variant** from it. Each variant produces a separate
`.app` with a distinct bundle ID so multiple worktrees can run simultaneously:

| Branch | Output | Bundle ID |
|---|---|---|
| `main` / `master` | `VellumX.app` | `com.ailuras.vellumx` |
| `feat/pdf` | `VellumX-feat-pdf.app` | `com.ailuras.vellumx.feat-pdf` |
| `fix/crash` | `VellumX-fix-crash.app` | `com.ailuras.vellumx.fix-crash` |

All variants share the same data directory
(`~/Library/Application Support/VellumX/`).

To override the variant explicitly: `./app/build-app.sh debug myfork`.

`build-app.sh` runs `swift build`, wraps the binary into a `.app` bundle with
[Info.plist](app/Info.plist) + [VellumX.entitlements](app/VellumX.entitlements),
patches the bundle ID when a variant is active, then ad-hoc code-signs it.

## Configuration

There is **no external config file**. `ConfigManager.effectiveConfig`
([Config.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/Config.swift)) builds the `AppConfig`
in-memory from three layers:

1. `AppConfig.builtin` ([ConfigDefaults.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/ConfigDefaults.swift))
   — API base URLs, the citation-score curve, OpenAlex query defaults.
2. `MetadataStore` — the venue taxonomy (`venues`), tier point values
   (`tiers`), tracks/keywords, and citation curve.
3. `AppSettings` — personalization knobs (recommendation, OpenAlex params,
   translation), which win.

Venue→tier/abbreviation matching is done **solely** by `VenueScorer` from
`MetadataStore.venues` — there are no hidden built-in venues.

### API key storage

The translation API key is stored in
`~/Library/Application Support/VellumX/settings.json` as plaintext (field
`apiKey`). This avoids macOS Keychain authorization dialogs that fire on every
rebuild when ad-hoc signing changes the binary hash. On first launch after
upgrading from an older build, the key is migrated automatically from the
Keychain; subsequent saves go to `settings.json` only.

`Keychain.swift` is kept for potential future use but is no longer called for
API keys.

## Data

[PaperStore.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/PaperStore.swift) is a `@MainActor`
`ObservableObject` backed by **SQLite3** (system `import SQLite3`, no ORM), in
WAL mode. The DB lives at
`~/Library/Application Support/VellumX/vellumx.db` by default (kept local, not
iCloud Drive, so the WAL sidecar files can't desync). The folder is
user-relocatable via Settings ▸ General (`AppSettings.storageDirectory`);
`PaperStore.relocate` moves the file and repoints `MetadataStore` at it.
[MetadataStore.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/MetadataStore.swift) opens a second
connection to the *same* file for the paper taxonomy tables.

All variant builds share this same directory.

## Architecture

- [VellumXApp.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/VellumXApp.swift) — App entry point
  (launched via `main.swift`). A `WindowGroup` (main two-column UI) plus a
  `MenuBarExtra` showing the day's top picks. Shares one `PaperStore.shared`.
- [ContentView.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/ContentView.swift) — the macOS
  two-column UI (left: category/track filter; right: detail + bilingual abstract).
- [OpenAlexFetcher.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/OpenAlexFetcher.swift) — paper
  fetching from OpenAlex.
- [RecommendEngine.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/RecommendEngine.swift) +
  [VenueScorer.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/VenueScorer.swift) — scoring by venue
  tier + citation breakpoints; picks the daily recommendations.
- [DeepSeekTranslator.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/DeepSeekTranslator.swift) —
  DeepSeek API abstract translation with local caching.
- [PdfResolver.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/PdfResolver.swift) — multi-tier OA PDF
  resolution (OpenAlex → Unpaywall → arXiv → Semantic Scholar).
- [Models.swift](app/Sources/VellumX/Models.swift) — `Paper` and related types.

## Testing

Unit tests live in [app/Tests/VellumXTests/](app/Tests/VellumXTests/) and cover
the pure business-logic layer (73 test cases):

| Suite | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `VenueScorerTests` | Venue matching, priority rules, citation scoring |
| `RecommendEngineTests` | Pool selection, slot allocation, deduplication |
| `PdfResolverTests` | DOI URL normalisation (`stripDoiPrefix`) |
| `PaperStoreHelpersTests` | `splitCSV`, `normalizedTag`, `parseSQLiteDate` |
| `MetadataStoreHelpersTests` | Field/tier normalisation, default point values |
| `CitationExporterTests` | Cite-key generation, BibTeX escaping/field output |

**What to test when adding new features:**
- Any pure function (no UI, no SQLite, no network) must have unit tests.
- Add a test case for every non-trivial edge case you identify while implementing.
- UI behaviour, SQLite writes, and network calls are verified manually.

**`scripts/restart.sh` runs `swift test` before every build.** If tests fail the
restart aborts — fix the tests before relaunching.

Requires Xcode (not just Command Line Tools) as the active developer directory:
```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

## Conventions

- Keep the dependency surface at zero: pure SwiftPM + system frameworks only
  (no Xcode project required — Command Line Tools build must keep working).
- `PaperStore` and `ConfigManager` are `@MainActor`; respect that when calling.
- Static helpers on `@MainActor` classes are also `@MainActor`-isolated; mark
  test classes `@MainActor` when calling them from XCTest.
- Paper status is a plain string (`"recommended"`, `"read"`, `"starred"`, …)
  set via `store.setPaperStatus(id:status:)`.
